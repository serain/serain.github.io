Hi James,

I think LabGenius is the most exciting company in London and I'd love to work with you.

I thought I would drop you an email to see if there's any role you would consider me for. I'm currently an Information Security Consultant. My interests have shifted towards DevOps, recognizing that the amazing developments there will allow us to manage and scale services to new heights.

More than a job, I'm looking to work at the cutting edge of tech in a fascinating field. I'm a big fan of hard SciFi (Peter Watts?) and want to be where the future is shaping. I have a profound fascination with Life Sciences. My mother is a Biochemist by formation, and I've naturally always been interested in the field from a young age.

I've attached my resume, I would love to know your thoughts. If you consider my profile interesting, I would greatly appreciate the chance to meet and discuss any current or future roles.

Regards,
Alex
